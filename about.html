Our team players handled the pressure with such composure, showing their mental strength.The team played 4 matches,won 3 of them and lost 1 match. The final match took place at Ambohitrimanjaka on 22 September,2024.After the victory,we can see how good the team's unity is to accomplish the objective.M.Abbas as the Man of The Match was a well deserved award.Our team is also preparing for next year tournaments every Sunday with other teams. </p>
